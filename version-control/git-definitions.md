# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control tracks the history of revisions to a file or files and can merge the revisions of different contributors. This ability is useful to protect against mistakes in revisions, because the file can be rolled back to an earlier version. Version control also allows multiple people to work on the same code base without risking the master copy.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a master file that serves as a working copy. Revisions can be made in this branch and the integrity of the master is preserved. Then, when we are sure that the revisions to the branch are safe and operational, we can merge these revisions back into the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

In Git, a commit is a save point. A good commit message is specific to the actual changes made. As well, standard practice has the verb written in the present tense. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict can occur under a few situations. One possibility is that different people made changes to the same line of the same file. A merge conflict can also occur when someone changes a file and someone else deletes that file.
