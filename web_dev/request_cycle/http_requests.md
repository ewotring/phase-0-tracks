What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request only retrieves data, while a POST request sends data to the server. The main difference is that GET only loads data, as in a picture or text, while POST submits data, like the information entered into a form by a user.

Optional bonus question:  What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

At bottom, a cookie is a piece of information from a web site that is stored locally on the user's computer. These pieces of information are often used to remember the user's history on the web site or other information about how the user used the site.

Cookies are often included in HTTP requests as a way to inform the server of the browser identity or history on the web site.
