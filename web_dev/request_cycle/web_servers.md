What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

One key element seems to be that the OS design is predicated on the fact that the user knows how to user a computer. This is meant to be egalitarian, in that every user has complete control of the system, rather than having a more complex system dictating what the user may do. Another design philosophy minimalism. That is, they say that a program should specialize in one thing.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is sort of like a partition of a larger machine. A VPS is a virtual machine, in that it has its own operating system. The advantages of a VPS are mainly that the user has more control over the VPS than with a shared server. A VPS allows the user to have root access, which is useful for full control. The VPS has its own resources; the resources are not shared with other websites on shared servers.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

One reason is that operating in root poses security threats. I've read that the root account should have logins disabled. Also, it is easier, if possible at all, to deal with mistakes in a non-root account. That is, a non-root deletion is less likely to damage the integrity of the system as a whole.
